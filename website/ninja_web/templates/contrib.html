                <h2>Guide to Helping With NINJA-IDEs</h2>
                <p>As with any open source project, there are several ways you can help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ninja-ide/topics">mailing list</a>
                        and answer other user's questions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Report bugs, feature requests and other issues in the
                        <a href="https://github.com/ninja-ide/ninja-ide/issues">issue tracking</a> system.
                    </li>
                    <li>Submit patches to reported issues (both those you find, or that others have filed)</li>
                    <li>
                        Help with the documentation by pointing out areas that are lacking or unclear, and if you are
                        so inclined, submitting patches to correct it. You can quickly contribute rough thoughts to the
                        <a href="https://github.com/ninja-ide/ninja-ide/wiki/Dojo">wiki</a>,
                        or you can volunteer to help collate and organize information that is already there.
                    </li>
                    <li>
